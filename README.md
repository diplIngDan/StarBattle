🚀 Star Battle: Browser Remake
A tactical, 5v5 multiplayer "Capital Ship MOBA" built for the modern web. Inspired by the legendary StarCraft II Arcade classic.

Status: 🟢 Alpha v0.1.0 — Playable in-browser.

🎮 The Gameplay
Unlike traditional fast-paced shooters, Star Battle is about the weight of massive warships. You don't dodge bullets; you manage your hull, cycle your energy, and coordinate fire with your fleet to bring down enemy structures.

Core Features:
Heavy Physics: Ships have inertia and slow turn rates, capturing the "Capital Ship" feel.

Energy Management: Abilities like the Yamato Cannon or Bio-Stasis require energy, forcing you to balance offense and defense.

Lane Tactics: Fight alongside AI-controlled minion waves to push toward the enemy Command Center.

Infinite Scaling: Use minerals from kills to upgrade your Hull, Shields, and Weapons at the base shop.
